Here is the README.md file with executive summery of what you did I Assignment II and what update I made for this Extension. 
I have Added Federated Identity Management functionality to my site I used one google platform as identity provider. I have used my site as service provider. Any one can sign in to your page using his account in one of the above platform.
I've choosen Angular web application framework to develop my site and for the purose of encryption and decryption algorithms I've employed crypto-js library which
is a growing collection of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns. They are fast, and they have a consistent and simple interface. So, I used it for the implementation of 3DES and AES algorithms. Since there's been a diffculty in implementing OTP in crypto-js
I've referred other resourses and prior knowldege for implementing it. On assignmnt extension which provides us to work on authentication, I've used google as an identity provider which is based on google cloud services.
